## 2. Square grammar puzzle

## 3. Custom plant
For my custom plant, I originally wanted to create something resembling a fern. However, unfortunatley Houdini crashed while I was working and I lost my fern :( For now, I decided to just try out the polygon creation rules to create a simple leaf. I will update with something more complex.
