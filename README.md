# lab03-grammars
Let's practice using grammars! For this lab, please pull up the L-system node in Houdini.

(okay to be more accurate to the prompt replace the negatives with positives)

## 3. Custom plant
Choose a plant in the world. Working off a reference, design a grammar that mimics the structure of that plant. Unlike our simple puzzles, please use multiple rules for greater complexity. Think carefully about the structure of your grammar! EXPLAIN the structure of your plant in the README. What are the components? What do each of the rules do? Be sure to also include images of a few iterations of your output plant.

- The tree is made up of stacks of a trunk, denoted with A, with 3 branches coming off it.
- Each branch, constructed by B, tapers and rotates upwards slightly.
- Some of these branches also contain C, which is a repeat of A except with only 1 iteration, causing more branching outward.
- The tree itself is tapered with a thick base that thins further upward.
